#Peer JavaScript Programming Challenge

In this challenge, you and your partner will program based on a set of instructions you will find inside the JavaScript file. Follow the instructions step-by-step and it will produce the result that is shown as the final step. Be sure to pay close attention to what the instructions are telling you.

How to Pair Program
While one of you is on the keyboard, programming what the other is telling you to program. As the programmer, if you know that you are on the wrong path, try to allow that moment to be a growth moment for your pair. Try to avoid simply making the correction.

There is a specific point in the exercise that you will be required to switch programmers. Even if you and your pair are in a groove, please make the switch. Getting the other perspective is key in the experience.
